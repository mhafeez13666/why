# why
Why I created this repo?

I have little more than 20 years of experience in the software industry. Writing code everyday is not part of my day job as you can imagine; me being a Senior Engineering Manager handling an Engineering analytics platform which supports a $2B dollar revenue generation for Cisco. But that shouldn't indicate the fact that I am not hands-on!! But what is hands-on mean when recruiters or companies ask?

I don't know but they ask :) and even one round of coding round is there in any interview for senior roles. I have no idea why and what they want from us but I love coding. 

And hence, this repo. 

I will put is some of my coding skills here and maybe write some re-usable components which anyone can use if they find it useful.

```
void main() { 

  int a[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
  printf("%d\n",5[a]); //hahaha an old time interview question. Will this work?

  return;

}
```
